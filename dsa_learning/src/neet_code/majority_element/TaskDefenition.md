# Majority Element
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in the array. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [5,5,1,1,1,5,5]

    Output: 5
Example 2:

    Input: nums = [2,2,2]

    Output: 2
Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 50,000
    -1,000,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000,000
    Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
